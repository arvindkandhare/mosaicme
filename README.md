## Introduction

Mosaicme is a [Microservice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices "Microservices") application that retrieves images from selected Twitter feeds, stores them on an [object store](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage "Object Store"), and then it process them to build a mosaic based on a selected set of pictures. 

The MosaicMe application is a demo application to showcase how to design, build, and deploy a MicroService application. We have followed the best practices shared by the [12 Factor App](http://12factor.net/) manifest and best of breed DevOps practices to showcase how to do continuous integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) to automate the deployment of the application. The application includes the following: 

- Use of Linux containers to host each service.
- Use of Object stores.
- Restful APIs as communication Channel ([REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer "REST"), [S3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3 "AWS S3"), [SWIFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack#Swift "OpenStack Swift"), [HDFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop#HDFS "Haddop Distributed File System"))
- Use of External Services like Twitter and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/ "Twilio.com"))
- Automated deployment model
- Use of a Logging Router
- Use of Queuing, Caching and Configuration Services 
- Use of Haddop to calculate statistics
- Use of Puppet/Chef to deploy the application

## Use Cases


The following section provides an overview of the Use Cases for MosaicMe. There are two main actors for this application  only one actor for this application, the end-user:
 
Use Case	                          | Description | Completed
------------------------------------- | -----------|-------------|
Retrieve images from Twitter feeds (Hashtags) | MosaicMe retrieves images from the defined list of Twitter hashtags and stores them in the Object store. The pictures are used to build the image library that will be used for building each mosaic. the EMC Code and EMCWorld twitter accounts. | Yes
Process a mosaic from a submitted picture | MosaicMe monitors a Twitter hashtag (#MosaicMe) for pictures. Once a picture is detected, it will build a mosaic from the submitted picture using the stored pictures in the object store.| Yes
Tweet Mosaic to Twitter Account		  | MosaicMe will Tweet the mosaic to the person that tweeted to the selected Twitter hashtag (#MosaicMe) | Yes
Display list Mosaics				  | Shows the list of mosaics currently stored in the system. The data will be available via the Web UI, API and ECS.| Yes
View and Zoom into Mosaic | Select a mosaic, display mosaic in a full screen and provide ability to zoom into the mosaic to view in detail, the raw pictures used for the composition. | Yes 
Configure Mosaicme 					  | Enables administrator to configure the system via a web interface. | No
Mosaicme statistics                   | Generates a list of statistics based on usage, storage, and images. meta data. Will use a Haddop cluster to process the stadistics. | No	
		



## Architecture 

Mosaicme is composed of multiple tiers. The following design shows the high level application architecture: 
The following diagram shows Mosaicme high level architecture:

The following has an overview of each one of the components:


Component Name              |	Component Description | Completed
--------------------------- | ---------------------|---------------|
Web Interface               | Web Interface to for displaying pictures, mosaics, statistics and system configuration. | Yes
Mosaic processing service   | Mosaic processing service. Takes the mosaic generation request from the Orchestration API and generates the mosaic data and meta data. | Yes
Queuing Service				| Service to host the queues required by the system. | Yes
Twitter retrieval service   | Service that retrieves pictures and their meta data from the selected twitter accounts and adds them Object store. | Yes
Statistics Service			| Haddop Cluster that takes the data in the Object Store and processes the statistics. Stores the data back to the Object store using HDFS. | No
Caching Service             | Data caching service to speed the Web application. | Yes
Log Routing Service		    | Service to route all services logs to the Object Store. | No
Configuration & registry Service       | Service to maintain configuration, synchronization and naming registry. | No
